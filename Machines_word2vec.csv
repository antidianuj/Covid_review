"this condition needs a
ventilator that feeds oxygen into the lungs and removes carbon dioxide as healthy
lungs do [27]. It was as a result of this condition that the world ran out of ventilators
because they are do without in managing COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The ventilator
could be invasive or non-invasive. For severe cases, where patients cannot
breathe on their own, invasive ventilators are used, and for less severe cases, where
the patients need assisted breathing, non-invasive ventilators are used [26, 28]",1,0,Ventilators

"A Wireless, Automatic Hand Wash Sensor and Timer
Washing hands for 20 seconds can be difficult. We built a device to help keep it up, and keep track of the habit. We built an automatic hand wash timer that helps us wash our hands for 20 seconds â€“ and to keep the habit going.",0,1,Dispensors
"According to certain findings, the authors noted that the contamination of hand washing surfaces can lead to the spread of microbial contamination in hospitals, and which can provide a pool of the microbial contamination, and finally, it can result in the contamination of hands during or after hand washing. In addition, they tested three areas of hand contact surfaces, namely: faucet handles, soap dispenser activation mechanisms and folded paper towel dispenser outlets. Finally, the obtained results indicate that the surfaces most sensitive to contamination are the faucet handles more than others.",0,0,Dispensors
"The rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19 after prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit is often complex and challenging. Patients may develop a myriad of long-term multi-organ impairments, affecting the respiratory, cardiac, neurological, digestive and musculoskeletal systems. Skeletal muscle dysfunction of respiratory and limb muscles, commonly referred to as intensive care unit acquired weakness, occurs in approximately 40% of all patients admitted to intensive care. The impact on mobility and return to activities of daily living is severe. Furthermore, many patients experience ongoing symptoms of fatigue, weakness and shortness of breath, in what is being described as ""long COVID"". Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is a technique in which small electrical impulses are applied to skeletal muscle to cause contractions when voluntary muscle contraction is difficult or impossible. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation can prevent muscle atrophy, improve muscle strength and function, maintain blood flow and reduce oedema. This review examines the evidence, current guidelines, and proposed benefits of using neuromuscular electrical stimulation with patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Practical recommendations for using electrical muscle stimulation in patients with COVID-19 are provided, and suggestions for further research are proposed.",2,0,Simulators
"Persons suffering with systemic neuromuscular disorders or chronic organ failures, spend less time for daily physical activity, aggravating their mobility impairments. From 2020, patients at risk are also older adults, who, though negative for the SARS-Cov-2 infection, suffer with a fatigue syndrome due to home restriction/quarantine. Besides eventual psycological managements, it could be useful to offer to these patients a rehabilitation workouts easy to learn and to independently repeat at home (Full-Body In-Bed Gym). Inspired by the proven capability to recover skeletal muscle contractility and strength by home-based volitional exercises and functional electrical stimulation (FES), we suggest for this fatigue syndrome a 10â€“20 min long daily routine of easy and safe physical exercises that may recover from muscle weakness the main 400 skeletal muscles used for every-day activities. Leg muscles could be trained also by an adjunctive neuro-muscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in frail old persons. Many of the exercises could be performed in bed (Full-Body in-Bed Gym), thus hospitalized patients can learn this light training before leaving the hospital. Full-Body in-Bed Gym is, indeed, an extension of well-established cardiovascular-ventilation rehabilitation training performed by patients after heavy surgery. Blood pressure readings, monitored before and after daily routine of Full-Body in-Bed Gym, demonstrate a transient decrease in peripheral resistance due to increased blood flow to major body muscles. Continued regularly, Full-Body in-Bed Gym may help maintaining independence of frail people, including those suffering with the fatigue syndrome related to the restrictions/quarantine imposed to the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0,0,Simulators
Vacuum exhausted isolation locker (VEIL) to reduce inpatient droplet/aerosol transmission during COVID-19 pandemic,0,0,Aersol Containers
"As the COVID-19 pandemic has created shortages of vital personal protective equipment that threatens healthcare workersâ€™ risk of exposure, a need for innovative new ways to protect healthcare workers has emerged. An aerosol containment box that covers the patientâ€™s head and neck in bed provides a solution to protect clinicians during aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation. We collaborated with original designer HYL and modified the size to adapt to larger patients and operator mobility. We expand its applicability by allowing the use of different instruments. The container is outfitted with an ultra-low particulate air-equipped filtration vacuum device to create negative pressure within the chamber and actively remove floating droplet nuclei generated during a procedure. This barrier method will be a valuable and economical option to protect healthcare workers on the front line globally during this pandemic and beyond.",16,0,Aerosol Containers
Healthcare workers (HCW's) are at increased risk of corona virus disease (COVID-19) infection during aerosol generating activities. The aerosol box has been used during intubation and extubation to prevent transmission of infection to HCWs. Isolation room with negative pressure has been advocated for COVID-19 patients. The described containment box has been designed to be useful in COVID intensive care unit (ICU) as a multipurpose box which is a cost effective and readily available resource. This innovation combines the containment box with negative pressure generation using central vacuum,4,0,Aerosol Containers
"bedside bladder ultrasound, hand-held arterial dopplers, bedside echocardiography, bedside lung ultrasound, ultrasounds for line placements, urine dipstick, urine toxicology, EKG leads. Bedside POC ultrasound offers clinicians the ability to obtain lung and heart images and observe abdominal fluid accumulation and drainage of pleural fluid; it also provides guidance for central line placement, toward monitoring of mechanically ventilated patients who are the most seriously affected by COVID-19 [22]. Bedside POC ultrasound also reduces radiation exposure compared with repeated radiography. Continuous respiratory rate monitoring in this fashion potentially allows earlier identification of patient deterioration and assists with having ICU beds available for critically ill patients. Additional smart bed features include easy-to-interpret automatic alarms and an operator-friendly user interface.",5,0,Beds

"This has led many scientists to develop super-rapid testing methods using breath samples. Such devices are less socially awkward and can deliver results in under a minute—fast enough to feasibly screen large crowds as they pass through hubs. Here, IEEE Spectrum has selected five different approaches to analyzing breath for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some of these technologies can sense the virus directly. Others pick up indirect indicators, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These molecules are present in healthy breath, but change in ratio when a person is infected with the virus.",0,1,Breathanalyzers
"Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study so far that investigated the potency of
electronic noses in detecting COVID-19 patients at bedside clinical setting. The existing study of
electronic nose application (Aeonose) on SARS-CoV2 detection was on pre-operative screening.",1,0,Breathanalyzers
